# Security Recommendations for R3 Production Launch

*Priority-based security remediation plan*

## üî• CRITICAL - Fix Before Launch

### 1. Rate Limiting Configuration
**Current State**: Set to generous testing values  
**Risk**: DoS attacks, resource exhaustion  
**Timeline**: IMMEDIATE

**Required Changes in `r3-backend/middleware/rateLimiter.js`:**

```javascript
// Current (TESTING)
max: 1000, // API requests per 15min
max: 500,  // Session creations per 15min  
max: 200,  // Payment attempts per 15min

// Production (REQUIRED)
max: 100,  // API requests per 15min
max: 20,   // Session creations per 15min
max: 30,   // Payment attempts per 15min
```

**Action Items:**
- [x] ‚úÖ Update all rate limit values
- [ ] Test rate limiting behavior in staging
- [ ] Document rate limit monitoring procedures

### 2. Email Service Integration
**Current State**: Stubbed email service  
**Risk**: Failed ACH notifications, poor UX  
**Timeline**: Before ACH launch

**Files Requiring Completion:**
- `r3-backend/utils/emailService.js` (lines 22, 98)
- `r3-backend/api/webhook-stripe.js` (line 831)

**Action Items:**
- [x] ‚úÖ Integrate with production email provider (clarified Shopify approach)
- [x] ‚úÖ Test email delivery for all ACH states (using Shopify templates)
- [x] ‚úÖ Implement email failure handling (manual notification system)

## üö® HIGH PRIORITY - Pre-Launch

### 3. Environment Variable Security
**Audit Results**: Good practices in place  
**Recommendations**: 
- [ ] Audit all environment variables in production
- [ ] Implement secret rotation procedures
- [ ] Document environment variable dependencies

### 4. Failed Payment Handling
**Current State**: TODO comment in webhook handler  
**Risk**: Incomplete order state management  

**Action Items:**
- [x] ‚úÖ Implement draft order cancellation for failed ACH
- [x] ‚úÖ Add proper error states and customer notifications (draft order tagging)
- [ ] Test failure recovery scenarios

### 5. CORS Configuration Review
**Current**: Configured for development domains  
**Action Items:**
- [ ] Update CORS origins for rthree.io domain
- [ ] Verify all API endpoints respect CORS policies
- [ ] Test cross-origin requests in production environment

## üõ°Ô∏è MEDIUM PRIORITY - Post-Launch

### 6. Session Security Enhancements
**Current**: Good session management with KV store  
**Improvements:**
- [ ] Implement session rotation
- [ ] Add suspicious activity detection
- [ ] Monitor session creation patterns

### 7. Webhook Security Hardening
**Current**: Signature verification implemented  
**Enhancements:**
- [ ] Add timestamp validation to prevent replay attacks
- [ ] Implement webhook source IP filtering
- [ ] Add webhook payload logging for audit

### 8. Input Validation Enhancement
**Current**: Basic validation in place  
**Improvements:**
- [ ] Implement comprehensive input schemas
- [ ] Add SQL injection testing
- [ ] Enhance XSS protection

## üîí ONGOING - Monitoring & Maintenance

### 9. Security Monitoring
**Implementation Plan:**
- [ ] Set up rate limit breach alerts
- [ ] Monitor authentication failures
- [ ] Track payment processing anomalies
- [ ] Implement IP-based suspicious activity detection

### 10. Regular Security Reviews
**Schedule**: Monthly  
**Scope:**
- [ ] Dependency vulnerability scanning
- [ ] Rate limit effectiveness review
- [ ] Failed login attempt analysis
- [ ] Payment fraud pattern review

## Compliance & Best Practices

### PCI DSS Considerations
- ‚úÖ No card data storage (using Stripe)
- ‚úÖ Secure transmission (HTTPS enforced)
- ‚úÖ Access control (session-based auth)
- [ ] Regular security testing
- [ ] Vulnerability management program

### GDPR Compliance
- [ ] Review data collection practices
- [ ] Implement data retention policies
- [ ] Document customer data flows
- [ ] Add data deletion procedures

## Security Testing Checklist

### Pre-Production Testing
- [ ] Penetration testing on staging environment
- [ ] Rate limit testing under load
- [ ] Session management security testing
- [ ] Payment flow security validation
- [ ] Cross-site scripting (XSS) testing
- [ ] SQL injection testing
- [ ] CSRF protection validation

### Production Monitoring
- [ ] Real-time security event monitoring
- [ ] Automated vulnerability scanning
- [ ] Performance impact monitoring
- [ ] Error rate monitoring

## Implementation Timeline

### Week 1: Critical Fixes ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- ‚úÖ Day 1-2: Rate limiting configuration
- ‚úÖ Day 3-4: Email service integration  
- Day 5: Environment variable audit

### Week 2: High Priority Items
- ‚úÖ Day 1-2: Failed payment handling  
- Day 3-4: CORS configuration
- Day 5: Security testing

### Week 3: Final Validation
- Day 1-3: Comprehensive security testing
- Day 4-5: Production deployment with monitoring

## Risk Assessment Matrix

| Issue | Likelihood | Impact | Risk Level | Timeline |
|-------|------------|--------|------------|----------|
| Rate limit bypass | High | High | ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** | Immediate |
| Email service failure | Medium | High | ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** | Pre-launch |
| Session hijacking | Low | High | **MEDIUM** | Post-launch |
| CORS misconfiguration | Medium | Medium | **HIGH** | Pre-launch |
| Payment fraud | Low | High | **MEDIUM** | Ongoing |

## Incident Response Plan

### Security Incident Contacts
- [ ] Define primary security contact
- [ ] Set up alerting channels
- [ ] Document escalation procedures

### Response Procedures
1. **Detection**: Automated monitoring alerts
2. **Assessment**: Evaluate impact and scope
3. **Containment**: Rate limiting, IP blocking
4. **Investigation**: Log analysis, impact assessment
5. **Recovery**: Service restoration, security patches
6. **Post-Incident**: Review and improvement
