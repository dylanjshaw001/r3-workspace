*Executive Business Case - August 2025*

## Executive Summary: A Game-Changing Investment

The R3 platform migration from Webflow to custom Shopify represents one of the most strategically sound technology investments in our company's history. This isn't just a platform upgradeâ€”it's a complete transformation that unlocks previously impossible business capabilities while delivering measurable ROI from day one.

- **Market Differentiation**: Unique capabilities that competitors cannot replicate

## The Migration Imperative: Why Change Was Essential

### Webflow Limitations That Were Killing Our Growth
